MicSwitch is a tool which allows you to mute/unmute your microphone using a predefined hotkey. 
This is system-wide thus it will affect any program which uses microphone (no more heavy breathing during Skype conferences, hooray!)
Also MicSwitch supports configurable mute/unmute sounds (hi, Discord!) and a configurable overlay with scaling/opacity support.

## Features
- Multiple microphones support (useful for streamers)
- System-wide hotkey (supports mouse XButtons)
- Overlay
- Mute/unmute audio notification
- Two Hotkey modes: Push-to-talk and Toggle-mute
- Auto-update via Github
